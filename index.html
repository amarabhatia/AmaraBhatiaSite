   <h1>Reasons Sleep is Bad</h1>
   <h3>An essay written by: Amara Bhatia</h3>
   <p>In this essay I will explain the reasons why due to sleep we become brainwashed to the government <br>
     We as a human race say we need sleep but do we really? <br>
     What happens when we fall asleep? <br>
     I know the answers. <br>
     We as a human race sleep when the sun goes down. And during that time little things we can refer <br>
     to as <em>night bugs</em>  created by the government come alive and crawl into our ears and into our brains, <br>
     they implant thoughts that they think we need to hear so that they can control us. We each have  <br>
     our own <em>night bugs</em> and each have an individual person controlling them in our 
     <br> <strong>Because mole people are real.</strong>  
   </p>
     
<!--here is where i move on from paragraph and start listing things HOW DO I DO IT -->
   <h2> <em> Reasons to fear night bugs:</em></h2>
   <ol>
       <li> <strong> They can murder you if they think you are smelly</strong></li>
       <ul><li>With that in mind make sure to leave a stick <br> 
        of cheese by your bed as peace offering</li></ul>
       <li> <strong>They hate humans and all of mankind</strong> </li>
       <ul><li>Although we created them they hate us</li></ul>
       <li> <strong> They are controlled by the government and mole <br> 
        people who hate humans for stealing their spot in society</strong></li>
       <ul><li>For more backstory we stole their land and forced <br>
         them to live underground with a computer screen as  <br> their
          only friend</li></ul>
