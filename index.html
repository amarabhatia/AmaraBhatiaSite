   <h1>Reasons Sleep is Bad</h1>
   <h3>An essay written by: Amara Bhatia</h3>
   <p>In this essay I will explain the reasons why due to sleep we become brainwashed to the government <br>
     We as a human race say we need sleep but do we really? <br>
     What happens when we fall asleep? <br>
     I know the answers. <br>
     We as a human race sleep when the sun goes down. And during that time little things we can refer <br>
     to as <em>night bugs</em>  created by the government come alive and crawl into our ears and into our brains, <br>
     they implant thoughts that they think we need to hear so that they can control us. We each have  <br>
     our own <em>night bugs</em> and each have an individual person controlling them in our 
     <br> <strong>Because mole people are real.</strong>
